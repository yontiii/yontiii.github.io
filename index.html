      <h2>Why programing?</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">I have always wanted to do programing because it has always been interesting for me how the internet and its applications work.I think this was because I was exposed to computers at an early age.Thus my curiosity grew over the years.I believe the world can be changed through programming and we can be able to solve most of the problems that affect our day to day activities.</p>
